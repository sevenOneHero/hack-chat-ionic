Welcome to hack.chat, a minimal, distraction-free chat application.
Channels are created and joined by going to https://hack.chat/?your-channel. There are no channel lists, so a secret channel name can be used for private discussions.

Here are some pre-made channels you can join:
<span (click)='onChannelSelected(channel)' class="channel" *ngFor="let channel of predefinedChannels"> ?{{channel}} </span>
<span class="channel" (click)="doPrompt()">
  Enter Channel Name
</span>
